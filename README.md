Hey, I’m James Duffy (he/him). I’m a Manager of Cloud Engineering, where I focus on building reliable, scalable platforms for high-traffic applications.

Living in San Francisco, I spend my days simplifying infrastructure, optimizing tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, and mentoring engineering teams to deliver observable and resilient products. My background is in cloud infrastructure, Infrastructure as Code, and containerization.

My current focus includes:

- Managing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Istio, ArgoCD)
- Building Infrastructure as Code solutions with Terraform
- Improving reliability and observability across systems
- Mentoring teams and democratizing infrastructure for non-DevOps engineers

Hi! I am James Duffy (he/him). I currently work as a Manager of Cloud Engineering at Accolade, Inc.

I am passionate about building scalable, reliable platforms for high-traffic applications. Living and working in San Francisco, I focus on simplifying infrastructure, optimizing tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, and Istio, and mentoring engineering teams to deliver scalable, observable, and reliable products.

Most of my career has involved developing infrastructure for high-traffic websites, leading migrations to cloud-native solutions, and improving disaster recovery and system reliability. I have a strong background in Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and continuous integration pipelines.

My current focus includes:

- Managing cloud infrastructure (AWS, Kubernetes, Istio, ArgoCD)
- Building Infrastructure as Code solutions with Terraform
- Improving reliability and observability across systems
- Mentoring teams and democratizing infrastructure for non-DevOps engineers

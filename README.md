Hi! I am James Duffy (he/him). I currently work as a Lead Infrastructure Engineer.

I am passionate about my work and building things for the web. I live and work in San Francisco. Programming and scaling machines in the cloud is my norm. Most of my career has been building high traffic websites and the infrastructure that runs them.

My current focus is on building and managing infrastructure (servers, networking, etc.) with Terraform, setting up Kubernetes clusters and deployments, and building the continuous integration pipeline to deploy them.
